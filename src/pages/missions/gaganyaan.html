        <div style="padding-left: 5rem; padding-top: 15rem;">The primary mandate of HSFC is to spearhead ISRO's
          Gaganyaan programme through co-ordinated efforts and
          focus all the activities that are carried out in other ISRO centres, research labs in India, Indian
          academia and Industries towards accomplishing the mission. HSFC, as the lead Centre for Human space
          flight activities conforms to high standards of reliability and human safety in undertaking R&D
          activities in new technology areas, such as life support systems, Human Factors Engineering,
          Bioastronautics, Crew training and Human rating & certification.
          <br /><br /> These areas would constitute important
          components for future sustained human space flight activities like rendezvous and docking, space station
          building and interplanetary collaborative manned missions to Moon/Mars and near-earth
          asteroids.

      <div style="display: flex;">

        Gaganyaan project envisages demonstration of human spaceflight capability by launching crew of 3
        members
        to an orbit of 400 km for a 3 days mission and bring them back safely to earth, by landing in Indian
        sea
        waters.<br /><br />

        The project is accomplished through an optimal strategy by considering inhouse expertise, experience
        of
        Indian industry, intellectual capabilities of Indian academia & research institutions along with
        cutting
        edge technologies available with international agencies. The pre-requisites for Gaganyaan mission
        include development of many critical technologies including human rated launch vehicle for carrying
        crew
        safely to space, Life Support System to provide an earth like environment to crew in space, crew
        emergency escape provision and evolving crew management aspects for training, recovery and
        rehabilitation of crew.<br /><br />

        Various precursor missions are planned for demonstrating the Technology Preparedness Levels before
        carrying out the actual Human Space Flight mission. These demonstrator missions include Integrated
        Air
        Drop Test (IADT), Pad Abort Test (PAT) and Test Vehicle (TV) flights. Safety and reliability of all
        systems will be proven in unmanned missions preceding manned mission

        <div style="padding-right:5rem ; padding-top: 8rem;"> LVM3 rocket - The well proven and reliable heavy lift
          launcher of ISRO, is identified as the launch
          vehicle for Gaganyaan mission. It consists of solid stage, liquid stage and cryogenic stage. All systems
          in LVM3 launch vehicle are re-configured to meet human rating requirements and christened Human Rated
          LVM3. HLVM3 will be capable of launching the Orbital Module to an intended Low Earth Orbit of 400
          km.<br /><br /><br />

          HLVM3 consists of Crew Escape System (CES) powered by a set of quick acting, high burn rate solid motors
          which ensures that Crew Module along with crew is taken to a safe distance in case of any emergency
          either at launch pad or during ascent phase.</div>

        <div style="padding-left: 5rem; padding-top: 6rem;"> Orbital Module (OM) that will be Orbiting Earth
          comprises of Crew Module (CM) and Service Module (SM). OM is equipped with state-of-the-art avionics
          systems with adequate redundancy considering human safety.<br /><br />

          CM is the habitable space with Earth like environment in space for the crew. It is of double walled
          construction consisting of pressurized metallic Inner Structure and unpressurised External Structure
          with Thermal Protection System (TPS). It houses the crew interfaces, human centric products, life
          support system, avionics and deceleration systems. It is also designed for re-entry to ensure safety
          of the crew during descent till touchdown.<br /><br />

          SM will be used for providing necessary support to CM while in orbit. It is an unpressurized
          structure containing thermal system, propulsion system, power systems, avionics systems and
          deployment mechanisms.<br /><br />
