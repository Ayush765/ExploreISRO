                    The primary mandate of HSFC is to spearhead ISRO's Aditya L1 shall
                    be the first space based Indian mission to study the Sun. The
                    spacecraft shall be placed in a halo orbit around the Lagrange point
                    1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system, which is about 1.5 million km from
                    the Earth. A satellite placed in the halo orbit around the L1 point
                    has the major advantage of continuously viewing the Sun without any
                    occultation/eclipses. This will provide a greater advantage of
                    observing the solar activities and its effect on space weather in
                    real time. The spacecraft carries seven payloads to observe the
                    photosphere, chromosphere and the outermost layers of the Sun (the
                    corona) using electromagnetic and particle and magnetic field
                    detectors. Using the special vantage point L1, four payloads
                    directly view the Sun and the remaining three payloads carry out
                    in-situ studies of particles and fields at the Lagrange point L1,
                    thus providing important scientific studies of the propagatory
                    effect of solar dynamics in the interplanetary medium<br /><br /><br />

                    The suits of Aditya L1 payloads are expected to provide most crucial
                    informations to understand the problem of coronal heating, coronal
                    mass ejection, pre-flare and flare activities and their
                    characteristics, dynamics of space weather, propagation of particle
                    and fields etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        The major science objectives of Aditya-L1 mission are:<br /><br />

                        &nbsp;&nbsp; • Study of Solar upper atmospheric (chromosphere and
                        corona) dynamics.<br /><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Study of chromospheric and coronal heating, physics
                        of the partially ionized plasma, initiation of the coronal mass
                        ejections, and flares<br /><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Observe the in-situ particle and plasma environment
                        providing data for the study of particle dynamics from the Sun.<br /><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Physics of solar corona and its heating
                        mechanism.<br /><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Diagnostics of the coronal and coronal loops plasma:
                        Temperature, velocity and density.<br /><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Development, dynamics and origin of CMEs.<br /><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Identify the sequence of processes that occur at
                        multiple layers (chromosphere, base and extended corona) which
                        eventually leads to solar eruptive events.<br /><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; • Magnetic field topology and magnetic field
                        measurements in the solar corona .<br /><br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;• Drivers for space weather origin, composition and
                        dynamics of solar wind .<br /><br />
