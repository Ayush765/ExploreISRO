                <div style="padding-left: 5rem; padding-top: 5rem;">Sounding rockets are one or two stage solid
                    propellant rockets used for probing the upper atmospheric regions and for space research. They also
                    serve as easily affordable platforms to test or prove prototypes of new components or subsystems
                    intended for use in launch vehicles and satellites. With the establishment of the Thumba Equatorial
                    Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1963 at Thumba, a location close to the magnetic equator, there
                    was a quantum jump in the scope for aeronomy and atmospheric sciences in India. The launch of the
                    first sounding rocket from Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala on 21 November 1963, marked the
                    beginning of the Indian Space Programme . Sounding rockets made it possible to probe the atmosphere
                    in situ using rocket-borne instrumentation. The first rockets were two-stage rockets imported from
                    Russia (M-100) and France (Centaure). While the M-100 could carry a payload of 70 kg to an altitude
                    of 85 km, the Centaure was capable of reaching 150 km with a payload of approximately 30 kg. <br>
                    <br>
                    ISRO started launching indigenously made sounding rockets from 1965 and experience gained was of
                    immense value in the mastering of solid propellant technology. In 1975, all sounding rocket
                    activities were consolidated under the Rohini Sounding Rocket (RSR) Programme. RH-75, with a
                    diameter of 75mm was the first truly Indian sounding rocket, which was followed by RH-100 and RH-125
                    rockets. The sounding rocket programme was the bedrock on which the edifice of launch vehicle
                    technology in ISRO could be built. It is possible to conduct coordinated campaigns by simultaneously
                    launching sounding rockets from different locations. It is also possible to launch several sounding
                    rockets in a single day.

            <h2>General Specifications of Sounding Rockets</h2>
            Currently, three versions are offered as operational sounding rockets , which cover a payload range of 8-100
            Kg and an apogee range of 80-475 km.
